The platform utilizes a Lavender and Navy Blue palette to balance creative energy with professional authority.

* Lavender & Purple (#7c3aed, #d8b4fe): Used for interactive highlights, glows, and accents to provide a modern, SaaS-like aesthetic.
* Glassmorphism: Implementation of blurred backgrounds and semi-transparent borders to create a layered, "Apple-style" UI.

* Tailwind CSS: Utility-first framework used for responsive layouts and modern styling.
